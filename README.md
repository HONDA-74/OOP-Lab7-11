# 🧪 OOP Labs – C++

This repository contains a collection of OOP labs implemented in C++ as part of the ITI training program.  
Each lab focuses on a specific Object-Oriented Programming concept such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and more.

## 📌 Labs Included

### ✅ **Lab 7 – Classes & Encapsulation**
- Creating basic classes with private attributes  
- Constructors & setters/getters  
- Simple display functions  
- Working with objects and arrays of objects  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
All labs follow the same structure:
```
/
├── Lab7/
│ ├── .. 
  ├── calc.cpp  
  ├── main.cpp  
  ├── student.cpp  
  ├── student.h  
└── README.md  
```

This keeps the code modular and easy to expand as new labs are added.

---

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
- Classes & Objects  
- Encapsulation  
- Constructors  
- Basic OOP structure (header + source + main)

(When new labs are added, this section will grow gradually.)
