# 🧪 OOP Labs – C++

This repository contains a collection of OOP labs implemented in C++ as part of the ITI training program.  
Each lab focuses on a specific Object-Oriented Programming concept such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and more.

## 📌 Labs Overview

### ✅ Lab 7 – Classes & Basic OOP  
This lab focuses on practicing:
- Creating classes with private attributes  
- Constructors, setters, and getters  
- Operator overloading (e.g., Complex numbers)  
- Basic bank account simulation  
- Simple stack implementation using classes  

**Files included in Lab7:**  
- `bankAccount.cpp`  
- `complex.cpp`  
- `stack.cpp`  
- `main.cpp`  
- Executable files (`.exe`) generated after compilation

```
/
├── Lab7/
│ ├── bankAccount.cpp
│ ├── complex.cpp
│ ├── stack.cpp
│ ├── main.cpp
│ └── *.exe / *.o ← compiled output
├── Lab8/ ← will be added later
