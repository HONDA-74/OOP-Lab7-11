# 🧪 OOP Labs – C++

This repository contains a collection of OOP labs implemented in C++ as part of the ITI training program.  
Each lab focuses on a specific Object-Oriented Programming concept such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism.

### ✅ Lab 7 – Classes & Object-Oriented Basics

Lab 7 covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, including:

- Defining classes & objects  
- Constructors and accessors  
- Operator overloading  
- Simple stack implementation  
- Bank account simulation  

**Files included:**
- `bankAccount.cpp`
- `complex.cpp`
- `stack.cpp`
- `main.cpp`
- Executables: `.exe`, `.o`

### 🧪 Lab 8 – Extended OOP Practice

Lab 8 extends Lab 7 with more structured code and multiple compilation units, practicing:

- Improved class design  
- Separate modules for each feature  
- Multiple executables for testing  

**Files included:**
- `bankAccount.cpp`
- `bankAccount.exe`
- `complex.cpp`
- `complex.exe`
- `main.cpp`
- `main.exe`
- `main.o`
- `stack.cpp`
- `stack.exe`

### 🧩 Lab 9 – Composition, Aggregation & Copy Control

Lab 9 introduces more advanced OOP concepts:

- Composition (Book → Author)
- Aggregation (Library → Books)
- Copy Constructor & Assignment Operator
- Dynamic memory handling
- Passing objects by reference

**Files included:**
- `main.cpp`
- `main2.cpp`
- `main.exe`
- `main2.exe`
- `main.o`
