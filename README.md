# 🧪 OOP Labs – C++

This repository contains a collection of OOP labs implemented in **C++** as part of the **ITI training program**.  
Each lab focuses on a different Object-Oriented Programming concept such as classes, operator overloading, inheritance, and data structures.

---

## 📌 Labs Overview

---

### ✅ **Lab 7 – Classes & Basic OOP**
This lab focuses on practicing:
- Creating classes with private attributes  
- Constructors, setters, and getters  
- Operator overloading (Complex numbers)  
- Basic bank account simulation  
- Simple stack implementation using classes  

**Files included in Lab 7:**  
- `bankAccount.cpp`  
- `complex.cpp`  
- `stack.cpp`  
- `main.cpp`  
- Executables (`.exe`) generated after compilation  

---

### 🆕 **Lab 8 – Advanced OOP Practice**
This lab extends Lab 7 by adding more structured implementations and testing multiple programs separately.  
It includes:

- More organized C++ programs  
- Separate executables for each program  
- Handling multiple compilation units  
- Practicing OOP through different use-cases (Bank Account, Complex Numbers, Stack)

**Files included in Lab 8:**
- `bankAccount.cpp`  
- `bankAccount.exe`  
- `complex.cpp`  
- `complex.exe`  
- `main.cpp`  
- `main.exe`  
- `main.o`  
- `stack.cpp`  
- `stack.exe`  

> 📌 *Each `.exe` file represents the compiled version of its corresponding `.cpp` file.*
